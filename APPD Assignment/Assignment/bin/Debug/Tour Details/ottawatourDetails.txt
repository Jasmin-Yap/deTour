DAY 4 of Winter Wonderland

MORNING
Wakey! We'll be heading under the hot sun outside of our hotel. As the name implied, we'll literally be
"Malaysia's Hottest"! We will be staying here for the rest of the day till just before sunset.

EVENING
As sunset is approaching, we'll head back to the hotel to hydrate but not give you food.
Watching sunset in Malaysia would be a crime if you are a tourist. Malaysia owns the sun.
Now you are allowed to buy your food at a cost of 300RM/gram.

MORNING
Everyone will gather at the hotel lobby by 6AM for a long-filled day.
We will be taking a spaceship to the sun for suntan. Anybody not here for suntan will either be kicked
